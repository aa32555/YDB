/* This is the STAPI signal thread (formerly referred to as the MAIN worker thread) that is created when a SimpleThreadAPI
 * call is done for the first time in the process.
 *
 * This thread has one of two purposes depending on the signal handling mode in effect:
 *
 * 1. When running with a C or C-like main routine that lets YottaDB's signal handlers do the heavy lifting, the purpose
 *    of this thread is to be the only thread that receives any SIGALRM (timer signal) signals sent to this process by the
 *    kernel (using "posix_timer_thread_id" global variable which is later used in "sys_settimer" function). Towards that this
 *    thread is in a 1 second sleep loop that will be interrupted if a SIGALRM is received OR if the sleep times out
 *    and then handles the timer signal right away by invoking the "timer_handler" function IF it can get the
 *    YDB engine multi-thread lock. If it cannot get the lock, then it finds the thread that owns that lock currently and
 *    forwards the signal to that thread that way the "timer_handler" function is invoked in a timely fashion from a thread
 *    that can safely invoke it. In addition, if any signals other than SIGALRM also come in directed at this thread, they are
 *    also handled/forwarded in a similar fashion.
 *
 * 2. When running with a Go or similar main routine where we let the main handle the signals and pass them into YottaDB, this
 *    thread has a similar job. It needs to look for pending signal blocks queued on sigPendingQue and if it finds them, it
 *    should grab the YottaDB engine lock and process any signal(s) on the queue.
 *
 * Note there is no parameter or return value from this routine currently (both passed as NULL).
 * The routine signature (with "dummy_parm" as an input parameter) is dictated by this routine being driven by "pthread_create".
