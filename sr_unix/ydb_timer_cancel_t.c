 * ydb_timer_cancel(), we don't do any of the exclusive access checks here. The thread management itself takes care
 * of most of that currently but also the check in LIBYOTTADB_INIT*() macro will happen in ydb_timer_cancel() still
 * so no need for it here. The one exception to this is that we need to make sure the run time is alive.
 *
 * Parms and return - same as ydb_delete_s() except for the addition of tptoken and errstr.
