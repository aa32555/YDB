#
# Wrapper for op_tstart that rebuffers the arguments and adds an arg to the front of the list to so op_tstart
# knows whether it was called from generated code or from C code since it handles TP restarts differently in
# those cases. This routine also saves/reloads the stackframe and related pointers because on an indirect call
# op_tstart() may shift the stack frame due to where it needs to put the TPHOST mv_stent.
#
# Parameters:
#    arg0:      (int) SERIAL flag
#    arg1:      (mval *) transaction id
#    arg2:      (int) count of local vars to be saved/restored
#    arg3-arg5: (mval *) list of (arg2) mvals (continuing on stack if needed) containing the NAMES of variables
#               to be saved and restored on a TP restart.
#
# Note no need to save %rbp in the prologue as it gets reset to the new frame when we return. Note also we subtract
# 8 from FRAME_SIZE because this routine pops the return address after putframe saves it. So instead of removing the
# stack space for the return address then adding 16 bytes for save area, just reduce by the difference.

	# We have more than 2 local variable names to save/restore so we need some aligned space on the stack for
	# parameters that don't fit in the 6 parm registers. Only the first two var name parameters can fit in
	# parm registers though a third var was initially in a parm reg but is now to be shifted to the stack since
	# this code adds a parm. All other parms s must reside on the stack starting at the lowest address. So for
	# example, if we need 7 slots, we must allocate 8 slots to keep the stack aligned but the 7 slots used must
	# be those with the lowest address for this to work correctly.
